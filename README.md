# ‚öΩ Football Player Re-identification

This project aims to detect and consistently re-identify football players across video frames using computer vision techniques. The core logic is implemented in the Jupyter notebook: `football-stealth.ipynb`.

The system attempts to track players across multiple frames by assigning consistent IDs, even as they move or change direction, using a combination of detection and tracking logic.
